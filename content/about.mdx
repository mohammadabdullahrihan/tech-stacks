Awesome Stacks is a community-curated list of tech stacks for different types of applications. It is open source and inspired by the original [awesome list](http://awesome.re/). See the <a href={props.data.site.siteMetadata.repository}>README</a> to view the stacks in traditional awesome list format.

Each item in the list is a stack with a name, description, and a handful of key tools. Stacks are grouped into categories based on their architecture, the problem they solve, or the core languages and frameworks involved, like *LAMP* or *JAMStack* or *Serverless*.

### What is awesomestacks.dev?

This site, built with Gatsby and React, turns the stacks and tools from the README and into a browseable format that includes data from the GitHub and StackShare APIs. The data includes metrics that frequently change, like the number of GitHub stars. The site is built automatically with every push to the GitHub repository and hosted on Netlify.

### Who writes the awesome stacks?

You do! Just like awesome lists, anyone is welcome and encouraged to contribute their knowledge. See the [Contribution Guide](/docs) for how to get started.

### Who’s behind all this?

Awesome Stacks is built and maintained by [StackShare](https://https://stackshare.io/) with the help of [DeveloperMode](https://developermode.com/). StackShare’s mission is to help developers discover new tools and make more informed technology decisions.
