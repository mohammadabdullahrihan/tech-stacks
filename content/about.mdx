# Awesome Stacks

Awesome Stacks is a community-curated list of proven tech stacks for building different types of applications. It is open source and inspired by the original [awesome list](http://awesome.re/). See the <a href={props.data.site.siteMetadata.repository}>README</a> to view the stacks in traditional awesome list format.

### How does it work?

Each item in the list is a stack with a name, description, and list of tools in that stack. Stacks are grouped into categories based on their architecture, the problem they solve, or the core languages and frameworks involved. See the [guidelines](/docs/guidelines) for more information.

The stack data lives on the README and on awesomestacks.dev. The site gives contributors more room to go deeper about their stacks and a page to share.

### Who writes the awesome stacks?

You do! Just like awesome lists, anyone is welcome and encouraged to contribute their knowledge on GitHub. This can be done by adding new stacks or improving existing ones. See the [Contribution Guide](/docs) and the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stackshareio/awesome-stacks/blog/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started.

### Why stacks?

</div>

It helps to know what complementary projects developers are using as you make the plunge into new projects and unfamiliar territory.

### Who’s behind all this?

Awesome Stacks is built and maintained by [StackShare](https://https://stackshare.io/) with the help of [DeveloperMode](https://developermode.com/). StackShare’s mission is to help developers discover new tools and make more informed technology decisions.
