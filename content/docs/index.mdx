# Contribute an awesome stack

Learn here how to add an awesome stack or improve one.

Start with the [Create a stack](/docs/create-a-stack) or [Update a stack](/docs/update-a-stack/) guides, which show you how to contribute directly from GitHub.

[Develop locally](/docs/develop-locally) shows how to run this site in order to preview your changes.

Please also familiarize yourself with the [Guidelines](/docs/guidelines), which explains what components an awesome stack should have so that it gets approved.

If you want to learn more about how Awesome Stacks works, check out the [Reference](/docs/reference/).
