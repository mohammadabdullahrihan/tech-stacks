Awesome Stacks is a community-curated list of tech stacks that are known to work well for building different types of applications. It is open source and inspired by the original awesome list. We made it to make working with new stacks less scary.

### Philosophy

When building apps with technologies you’re not familiar with, it’s impossible to know every tool, library and dependency you’ll need in advance. It’s hard to get a sense for what people *actually use*. A lot of productivity can be spent in google search hell just trying to figure it out how all the puzzle pieces should fit together.

Blog posts tend to be too zoomed in on one tool and go out of date quickly, and long lists of repos tend to lack context. All of this makes expanding technical horizons less fun. Having some kind of map would make things better.

### How does it work?
The goal of each awesome stack is to make building something with a particular technology—like microservices, blockchain or Go—more approachable. At a minimum, each awesome stack tries to answer the questions “What tools will I need to build this?” and “How do they work together?”. Each stack contains a variety of documentation, tools, repositories, annotations and resource links to help point readers in the right direction.

### Who writes the awesome stacks?

You do! Just like awesome lists, anyone is welcome and encouraged to contribute their knowledge on GitHub, especially those developers looking to share their hard-earned domain expertise. This can be done by creating new stacks or enhancing existing ones. See the [Contribution Guide](/docs) and the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stackshareio/awesome-stacks/blog/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started.

### Who’s behind all this?
Awesome Stacks is built and maintained by [StackShare](https://https://stackshare.io/) with the help of [DeveloperMode](https://developermode.com/). StackShare’s mission is to help developers discover new tools and make more informed technology decisions. We hope that Awesome Stacks can unleash even more stack collaboration in the hopes of preparing and educating the next generations of developers.
