Awesome Stacks shows you **working tech stacks** for different types of applications. It is open source, driven by the community, and inspired by the original [awesome](http://awesome.re) list.

Each awesome stack contains a hand-selected list of tools along with detailed explanations that help you understand what each piece does, how it fits in and why it was chosen. All stacks are created by developers in the community and reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
