# Contribution Guide

Awesome Stacks is a list of tech stacks that are known to work great for building a certain thing. Each stack is created and maintained by developers in the community. This site lives on GitHub and managed via issues and pull requests.

There are two main forms of contribution:

- Submit a new stack
- Improve an existing stack

This documentation will show you how to do both.

## Overview

Awesome Stacks is built with:

- Gatsby
- MDX (Markdown + JSX)
- StackShare API
- GitHub API

See all the tools in this stack [on StackShare](https://stackshare.io/).
