## Introduction

A good site search helps keep visitors on your site instead of going back to Google to narrow in on what they were looking for and potentially ending up somewhere else. There are other benefits to having your own site search too, like the ability to surface the content that you really want people to see. Even with those benefits, for many developers site search is still a nice-to-have feature because it seems like a lot of effort and because drop-in solutions like Google Custom Search shows ads and have a poor UX.

This Awesome Stack contains the tools and resources that can be used together to add a site search without much hassle, in a way that should work for a large variety of sites. Where things can be done in multiple languages, we will highlight the JavaScript and Python methods as they are currently the two languages most known by developers building serverless apps.

## Search Engine

This Awesome Stack is the “Algolia way to do it” so Algolia will be where we store the data and perform queries against it. Algolia stores objects in JSON format, which makes it easy for most applications to model and upload their data.

<Tools>
  <StackShare name="algolia" {...props}>
    A fully hosted service to index and query data, with a lot of official and community clients, integrations and UI-building tools
  </StackShare>
</Tools>

## Crawling

There are two ways to get your data into Algolia so that it can be searched - crawl your site or write a script to upload records from your database. Crawling is generally easier to set up while uploading gives you more exact control over what gets indexed.

There’s no one single way to crawl a website and upload it to Algolia, but here are a few options, ranging from full-server to frameworks to do it yourself. Generally, you will hook these steps into your serverless CI/CD/deployment pipeline and run them for each new site deploy.

<Tools>
  <GitHub name="DeuxHuitHuit/algolia-webcrawler" {...props}>
    Handles both the crawler and the formatting and uploading of records.
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="algolia/docsearch" {...props}>
    Handles everything but not as much control over the data model, still can work great for 80% of use cases. Algolia will set it up free and run it on their own infrastructure for open source docs.
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="scrapy/scrapy" {...props}>
    The de facto scraper for Python, easy to use with a lot of features.
  </GitHub>
</Tools>

## Uploading

If your site is backed by a database, you can also convert your records to JSON directly and upload them to Algolia. This gives you more full customization but will require you to a write a script to do this. The Algolia API clients make this pretty easy.

<Tools>
  <GitHub name="algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript" {...props}>
    Algolia Search API Client for JavaScript platforms
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="algolia/algoliasearch-client-python" {...props}>
    Algolia Search API Client for Python
  </GitHub>
</Tools>

## Static site integrations

If you’re using one of the more popular static site generators, there’s a good chance Algolia or the community has created an integration you can use, instead of having to do the work yourself.

<Tools>
  <GitHub name="algolia/jekyll-algolia" {...props}>
    An official Algolia-supported way to create a search for websites based on jekyll.
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="algolia/gatsby-plugin-algolia" {...props}>
    Specify a list of queries to run and how to transform them into an array of objects to index. When you run gatsby build, it will publish those to Algolia.
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="10Dimensional/hugo-algolia" {...props}>
    An alternative to the Docsearch plugin, allowing for manual index exports. Supports YAML, JSON, and TOML front matter.
  </GitHub>
</Tools>

### User interface

Algolia has tools to build both an autocomplete-style search for site headers and a full-page search with their “instantsearch” suite of tools.

<Tools>
  <GitHub name="algolia/instantsearch.js" {...props}>
    Use to build a search page that can have facets, filters and other widgets
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="algolia/autocomplete.js" {...props}>
    Use for a standard drop-down interface, good if you’re putting a search bar in the site header
  </GitHub>
  <GitHub name="algolia/react-instantsearch" {...props}>
    The React version of instantsearch, goes great with React-based site frameworks like Gatsby.
  </GitHub>
</Tools>
