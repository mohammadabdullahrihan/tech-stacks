## Introduction

A good site search helps keep visitors on your site instead of going back to Google to narrow in on what they were looking for and potentially ending up somewhere else. There are other benefits to having your own site search too, like the ability to surface the content that you really want people to see. Even with those benefits, for many developers site search is still a nice-to-have feature because it seems like a lot of effort and because drop-in solutions like Google Custom Search shows ads and have a poor UX.

This Awesome Stack contains the tools and resources that can be used together to add a site search without much hassle, in a way that should work for a large variety of sites. Where things can be done in multiple languages, we will highlight the JavaScript and Python methods as they are currently the two languages most known by developers building serverless apps.

## Search engine

This Awesome Stack is the “Algolia way to do it” so Algolia will be where we store the data and perform queries against it. Algolia stores objects in JSON format, which makes it easy for most applications to model and upload their data.

## Crawling

There are two ways to get your data into Algolia so that it can be searched - crawl your site or write a script to upload records from your database. Crawling is generally easier to set up while uploading gives you more exact control over what gets indexed.

There’s no one single way to crawl a website and upload it to Algolia, but here are a few options, ranging from full-server to frameworks to do it yourself. Generally, you will hook these steps into your serverless CI/CD/deployment pipeline and run them for each new site deploy.
