## Introduction

Serverless promises on-demand, optimal performance for a fixed cost. Yet, we see that the current serverless platforms do not always hold up this promise in practice; serverless applications can suffer from cold starts, platform overhead, and unreliable performance.

If you're cost-sensitive, these problems can really add up. But don't worry, this awesome stack shows you the right tools and techniques to avoid accidentally getting a 5-figure AWS bill

## Function-as-a-Service tools

Even though your front-end might be static, your application will usually still need to run some dynamic code, like for user authentication or running background tasks. Rather than provisioning servers that cost money every hour, every day, you can pay for only the actual execution of code that you run. This pattern is known as "function-as-a-service" and their are are quite a few platforms for it now. Here are a few of the least expensive tools, which still offer a lot of power and flexibility.

<Tools>
  <Tool name="serverless/serverless" {...props} />
</Tools>

## Processing forms

Rather than use a custom FaaS for catching form submissions, you can use a service that already exists and will save you the headache of manually storing the data. Here are a few tools that can be used for free and have a developer-friendly API.


## Sending email

Sending email has traditionally been a back-end task, but can easily be done by combining a serverless function with an email-sending service. The services below have been selected because they have a generous free tier for developers.


## Utilities

These tools and packages will help you keep an eye on your serverless spending. Cost calculators can be configured to stop your processing if costs exceed a preset threshold. This can save you lots of money if your project ends up on the front page of Hacker News.
